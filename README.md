Templaty
========

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/templaty/badge/?version=latest)](https://templaty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**Templaty** is a code generator written in Python that focuses on generating
correct and readable code for programming languages. It features fine-grained
control over whitespacing and indentation and a rich meta-language that allows 
full control over the code to be generated.

ðŸŒˆ There now is [a syntax plugin for Vim][2]!

The template syntax was inspired by [Jinja2][1] and should be very easy to pick
up.

```
def sum_all_answers():
  {% for i in range(0, 5) %}
    answer{{i+1}} = {% if i % 2 == 0 %}get_input_from_alice(){% else %}get_input_from_bob(){% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  return {% join i in range(0, 10) with ' + ' %}answer{{i+1}}{% endjoin %}
```

Generates the following code:

```python
def sum_all_answers():
  answer1 = get_input_from_alice()
  answer2 = get_input_from_bob() 
  answer3 = get_input_from_alice() 
  answer4 = get_input_from_bob() 
  answer5 = get_input_from_alice() 
  return answer1 + answer2 + answer3 + answer4 + answer5
```


## Usage

Eventually, Templaty will be available on PyPi and you'll be able to issue the following command:

```
pip3 install -U --user templaty
```

This should make the main command `templaty` available in your terminal.

## FAQ

### Will this library support Python 2?

No. Python 2 has reached its end-of-life and the organisation recommends
everyone to upgrade to Python 3. Porting to Python 2 requires extra work
for no good reason.

### Is it safe to use this library in my web server?

No, absolutely not! Templaty is a tool meant to be run by developers, not
end-users. As such, it has little (if any) security checks. You should never
run untrusted input using Templaty, only code you wrote yourself or from a
developer you trust.

### What extension should I use for my template files?

It is recommended to use the `.tply` extension so that syntax plugins like 
[vim-templaty][2] automatically set up the right syntax highlighting for you.

If your template contains code in another programming language, simply prefix
the default file extension to `.tply`, e.g. `mytemplate.cc.tply`.

Templaty is licensed under the MIT license, in the hope it will help developers
write better programs.
