   This software is undergoing rapid development. Be aware that some things
   might not yet work as advertised. This message will be removed once a stable 
   release is reached.

**Templaty** is a code generator written in Python that focuses on generating
code for programming languages other than HTML. It features fine-grained
control over whitespacing and indentation and a rich meta-language that allows 
full control over the code to be generated.
